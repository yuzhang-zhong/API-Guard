description: Secure API credential handling for storing, retrieving, rotating, and using API keys, tokens, and service secrets without committing or exposing them. Use when Codex needs to save an API key securely, retrieve a stored API credential, inject a credential into a command or environment variable, audit secret-handling risk, rotate/delete API credentials, or prevent API keys from being leaked into files, logs, shell history, git commits, or final responses.

# API Guardian

## Overview

Use this skill to handle API keys and tokens as secrets. Prefer the bundled `scripts/api_guard.py` helper so credentials live in an OS-backed secret store and are injected into commands without being printed.

## Security Rules

- Never include raw API keys, bearer tokens, refresh tokens, passwords, private keys, or webhook signing secrets in final responses.
- Never write secrets to `.env`, config files, logs, notebooks, screenshots, transcripts, or git-tracked files unless the user explicitly requests a file-based credential workflow.
- Prefer hidden prompts, stdin, or already-set environment variables over command-line arguments because shell history and process listings can expose arguments.
- Use placeholders such as `<API_KEY>` in examples and documentation.
- Before committing, check for accidental secrets with `git status`, `git diff --cached`, and a targeted scan for likely secret files or token-looking strings.
- If a secret is exposed, treat it as compromised: tell the user to rotate it, remove it from files/history, and store the replacement with this skill.

## Bundled Helper

Use `scripts/api_guard.py` from this skill directory.

Supported stores:

- Windows: Windows Credential Manager via DPAPI-protected user credentials.
- macOS: Keychain through `/usr/bin/security`.
- Linux: Secret Service through `secret-tool`; fail closed if unavailable.

The helper intentionally has no plaintext fallback.

## Common Workflows

### Store a Credential

Prefer a hidden prompt:

```bash
python scripts/api_guard.py store openai
```

Use stdin when another tool supplies the key:

```bash
printf "%s" "$OPENAI_API_KEY" | python scripts/api_guard.py store openai --stdin
```

Use an existing environment variable:

```bash
python scripts/api_guard.py store openai --from-env OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Use a Credential Without Printing It

Inject the stored secret into a child process:

```bash
python scripts/api_guard.py run openai OPENAI_API_KEY -- python app.py
```

For shell commands, pass the command after `--`:

```bash
python scripts/api_guard.py run openai OPENAI_API_KEY -- npm test
```

### Retrieve a Credential

Default retrieval is redacted:

```bash
python scripts/api_guard.py get openai
```

Only reveal when the user explicitly needs the raw value:

```bash
python scripts/api_guard.py get openai --reveal
```

Do not paste a revealed secret into chat. If the secret must be moved, prefer a direct command pipeline or environment injection.

### List or Delete Credentials

```bash
python scripts/api_guard.py list
python scripts/api_guard.py delete openai
```

### Rotate a Credential

1. Ask the provider to create or regenerate the replacement key.
2. Store the replacement under the same logical name:

```bash
python scripts/api_guard.py store openai
```

3. Run a smoke test with `run`.
4. Revoke the old key in the provider console.

## Naming

Use short logical names such as `openai`, `github`, `stripe-prod`, `stripe-test`, or `anthropic-dev`. Do not put the secret value in the name.

## Git Safety Checklist

Before staging or pushing work that involved credentials:

```bash
git status --short
git diff
git diff --cached
```

Also inspect likely local secret files:

```bash
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

If `.env`, credential JSON, PEM files, or token caches appear, add safe ignore rules or remove the files from the repo before committing.
